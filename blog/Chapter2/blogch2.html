                      <p>
                        Granite Platform, Adobe's open web stack, serves as the technical foundation for AEM. <br>
                        It also provides the fundamental UI framework with the following key objectives:

                        <li> Providing an extensible UI. </li>

                        OSGi Framework

                      <p>
                        The OSGi framework is comprised of specifications that define a component and the model for Java.  <br>
                        One of OSGi's key advantages is its ability to allow each product segment to define its API with a set of exported Java bundles, specifying its required dependencies. <br>
                        Segments and services can be dynamically installed, activated, deactivated, refreshed, and uninstalled.
                        Various implementations of OSGi specifications exist, such as Eclipse Equinox, OSGi, or Apache Felix.  <br>
                        AEM incorporates Apache Felix in its technology stack.

                      <h2> Java Content Repository (JCR)</h2>
                      <p>
                        The JCR combines the features of file systems and RDBMS, aiming to provide the best of both worlds. <br>
                        As per JSR 283, "the Java Content Repository API defines an abstract model and a Java API for data storage and related services that are commonly used by content-oriented applications." <br>
                        The JCR storage model consists of a tree of nodes and properties. <br>
                        Nodes organize the content, and named properties store the actual data, either as real data (string, boolean, number, etc.) or as binary streams for storing files of arbitrary size. <br>
                        AEM 6.x utilizes Apache Oak as the JCR implementation.

                      <h2>Apache Sling</h2>
                      <p>AEM is developed using Sling, a web application framework based on REST principles that facilitates the streamlined development of content-oriented applications.<br>
                        Sling uses a JCR repository, such as Apache Jackrabbit or, in the case of AEM, the CRX Content Repository, as its data store. <br>
                        According to Apache Sling's official documentation, Sling maps HTTP request URLs to content resources based on the request's path, extensions, and selectors.<br>
                        Emphasizing convention over configuration, requests are handled by scripts and servlets dynamically selected based on the current resource.<br>
                        This enables meaningful URLs and resource-driven request processing, while Sling's modular nature allows specific server instances to include relevant information. Consequently, anything present in the JCR can be accessed in a RESTful manner through HTTP requests.
