                          <li> Typically, it is hosted on port 4502.</li>
                          <li>Creating an AEM instance involves naming the AEM JAR file as cq65-author-p4502.jar.</li>

                            <li>The publish instance primarily functions as an end-user website, dedicated to the display of content without content editing or authoring capabilities. </li>
                            <li> Typically, it is hosted on port 4503.</li>
                            <li>To set up an AEM instance, the AEM JAR file must be named cq65-publish-p4503.jar.</li>
                            <li>Content becomes accessible in the publish instance immediately upon activation, publication, or replication from the author instance.</li>
                            <li>Unpublishing content is also an option, allowing the removal of content from the live site or restricting its availability to end users.</li>
                            <li>The publish instance is commonly referred to as the publisher.</li>
                            <li>In scenarios anticipating a large number of users, multiple publishers can be employed for a single author instance to distribute the page access load.</li>

                        Creating an AEM instance requires both the AEM JAR file and a valid license in the same folder.

                          <li>The initial startup of AEM for the first time will require a substantial duration, approximately 15 to 20 minutes.</li> 
                          <li> However, subsequent startups will be much quicker, taking a maximum of 5 minutes to launch the instance.</li>

                    <li>
                    <p> If a specific AEM version is required for a project, the latest Service Pack can be installed from the Adobe Software Distribution URL:</p>

                          As part of the current installation, we will be installing the latest Service Pack, specifically version 6.5.11. <br>
                          Please note that in your case, the version may differ or be higher.<br>
                          Navigate to the CRX Package Manager to install the 6.5.11 service pack. <br><br>
                          Click on the "Update Package" option highlighted in red:<br>
                          localhost:4502/crx/packmgr<br>
                          <img alt="AEM Author " src="img/ch4img9.png" />

                    <li>
                      Clicking on the "Install" button, as indicated in the screenshot below, will initiate the installation of the service pack, upgrading the version from 6.5.0 to 6.5.11.0.
                      <br>After the installation process is complete, kindly wait for at least 15 to 20 minutes.<br>
                      <img alt="AEM Author " src="img/ch4img11.png" /> 
                    </li>



                      <li>
                        Access the following URL to confirm the successful completion of the installation. If the page is not loading correctly or if an error is encountered, please wait for 10 minutes before reattempting.

                      <li>
                        The page below will load to indicate a successful installation:<br>

                      </li>

                      

                      <li>
                        Verify the updated version once more by following step number 14, and it will display the revised version.<br>

                      <p>
                        In a similar fashion, after creating the publish folder, you can establish a publish instance. Simply position both the JAR file (cq65-publish-p4503.jar) and the license file in the same publish folder.
                      </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Note: </b>Typically, a publish instance is not created locally unless there is a specific need.<br>
                      AEM comes with default Core Components and the We.Retail project out of the box, facilitating the exploration of core features and examples.<br>
                      Further discussion on this will be covered in detail later.<br>
