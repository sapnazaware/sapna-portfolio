                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <h2> AEM Author:</h2>
                        <img alt="AEM Author " src="img/ch3img1.png" /> 
                        <img alt="AEM Author " src="img/ch3img2.png" />  
                        <ol>
                            <li>AEM Author instances are typically hosted on a remote server, operating on port 4502. </li>
                            <li> The instance resides behind an internal firewall on the remote server, often necessitating VPN access. </li>
                            <li>Users utilize the author instance to generate content and transfer it to Publishers through activation. </li>
                            <li> Additionally, the author instance serves as the environment for generating reports on authoring activity, uploading DAM assets, configuring components, and executing actions not intended for the website's end users.</li>
                            <li>The author instance holds authority over the content that gets published, allowing users to activate content for public visibility and deactivate it when necessary. </li>
                            <li>This process is facilitated through replication agents.  </li>
                            <li>The complete list of replication agents on the author instance can be viewed at /etc/replication/agents.author.html. </li>
                            <li> To configure replication agents, users can access the Tool Admin page at /miscadmin#/etc/replication, where they can edit existing agents by selecting and adjusting settings. </li>
                            <li> New replication agents are created through this admin page. </li>
                            <li>Replication agents are configured with a URL and credentials pointing to the publish instance. </li>
                            <li>The author instance transmits the content earmarked for publication to this URL (/bin/receive), and the publish instance processes the content, updating or creating pages/assets accordingly. </li>

                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    </li>

                  
                  
                    <p>The screenshot below illustrates the agents on the author page, highlighting the top three most commonly used replication agents, readily available by default.</p>

                    <ol>
                    <li>When conducting local code testing, it is typically performed on a local author instance. </li>
                    <li>While this suffices for most scenarios, when evaluating styles on an author instance, it is advisable to append "?wcmmode=disabled" to the URL being viewed. </li>
                    <li> This ensures a user experience closely aligned with what the end user will encounter.</li>
                    </ol>



                    <li>

                      <h2>
                        AEM Publish Instance:

                        <img alt="Publish Instance" src="img/ch3img4.png" />
                      </h2>
                    
                      <li>The AEM Publish instance is typically hosted on port 4503 or any port number which is odd number , providing accessibility for end users.</li>
                      <li>From publish instance AEM author can publish the content for the end user.</li>
                      <li>In the context of reverse replication, content is replicated or deactivated from the publish instance back to the author.</li>
                      <li>The AEM publish instance serves as the repository for the published content, supplying the dispatchers with the necessary content for user display. </li>
                      <li>Content is transferred from the author instance to the publish instance when an author activates specific content. </li>
                      <li>Publish instances resemble author instances in functionality, except for the actual content authoring capability. </li>
                      <li>If there is a need to inspect content in the JCR of the publish instance, you can directly access CRXDE at (crx/de/index.jsp) and log in to gain entry to all other tools.</li>
                      <li> Similarly, as with author instances, code must be deployed directly to the publishers to ensure accessibility for the user-facing site. </li>
                      <li>Typically, this deployment is facilitated through Jenkins, with specific Jenkins jobs linked to the publishers. </li>
                    </li>
